# Text-to-Voice
Text-to-Voice is a simple web app that converts text into speech using the Web Speech API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it lets users type text and hear it aloud with one click. It currently supports English (US), with future updates planned for multiple languages and voice customization.
